"""
An AI player for Othello.

Heuristic Description
---------------------
This AI evaluates non-terminal positions using a simple weighted
board heuristic. Each square on the board is assigned a weight
reflecting its strategic importance.  Corners are highly valuable,
adjacent edge squares are somewhat valuable or dangerous depending
on position, and interior squares are given small positive or
negative values.  Separate weight matrices are provided for 4x4,
6x6 and 8x8 boards.  During evaluation, the heuristic sums the
weights of all squares occupied by the root player and subtracts
the weights of squares occupied by the opponent.  This encourages
the AI to prefer stable corner and edge positions while avoiding
vulnerable interior spots.
